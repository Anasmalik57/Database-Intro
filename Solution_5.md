# Different Types of Classification in DBMS

In Database Management Systems (DBMS), data classification refers to organizing and categorizing data based on various criteria. Here are the different types of classification:

1. **Structural Classification:**

   - **Explanation:** Structural classification organizes data based on the structure of the database. It includes hierarchical, network, and relational models.
     - _Hierarchical Model:_ Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.
     - _Network Model:_ Extends the hierarchical model with more complex relationships, allowing each child to have multiple parents.
     - _Relational Model:_ Stores data in tables with rows and columns, establishing relationships between tables.

2. **Functional Classification:**

   - **Explanation:** Functional classification categorizes data based on its function or purpose within the organization. It includes operational, analytical, and archival data.
     - _Operational Data:_ Used for daily transactions and operational activities.
     - _Analytical Data:_ Used for decision-making and analysis, often aggregated or summarized.
     - _Archival Data:_ Historical data retained for reference or compliance purposes.

3. **Temporal Classification:**

   - **Explanation:** Temporal classification categorizes data based on the time dimension. It includes current, historical, and predictive data.
     - _Current Data:_ Represents the current state of affairs.
     - _Historical Data:_ Records past events or transactions.
     - _Predictive Data:_ Forecasts future trends or outcomes based on historical data and models.

4. **Access Classification:**

   - **Explanation:** Access classification categorizes data based on access patterns and permissions. It includes public, private, and restricted data.
     - _Public Data:_ Accessible to all users.
     - _Private Data:_ Accessible only to authorized users or groups.
     - _Restricted Data:_ Accessible to a limited subset of users based on specific criteria or permissions.

5. **Usage Classification:**
   - **Explanation:** Usage classification categorizes data based on how frequently it is accessed or modified. It includes hot, warm, and cold data.
     - _Hot Data:_ Frequently accessed or modified, often critical for operations.
     - _Warm Data:_ Accessed or modified occasionally, important but not critical.
     - _Cold Data:_ Rarely accessed or modified, typically archived for long-term storage.
