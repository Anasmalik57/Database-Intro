# Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems Tackled by DBMS

1. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:**
   - **Challenge:** Redundancy and inconsistency due to duplicate data across multiple files.
   - **DBMS Solution:** Normalization and relationship establishment to reduce redundancy and enforce data consistency.

2. **Limited Data Sharing and Accessibility:**
   - **Challenge:** Difficulty in sharing data among users and coordinating concurrent access.
   - **DBMS Solution:** Concurrency control and transaction management to facilitate simultaneous access and maintain data integrity.

3. **Data Security Concerns:**
   - **Challenge:** Lack of robust security features, making it hard to enforce access control.
   - **DBMS Solution:** User authentication, access control, and encryption to protect data from unauthorized access.

4. **Scalability Issues:**
   - **Challenge:** Inefficiency in managing and organizing files with growing data volume.
   - **DBMS Solution:** Data partitioning, indexing, and query optimization for efficient handling of large datasets.

5. **Limited Querying and Analysis Capabilities:**
   - **Challenge:** Cumbersome data retrieval and analysis without structured query language support.
   - **DBMS Solution:** Structured query language (SQL) support and query optimization techniques for efficient data querying and analysis.
